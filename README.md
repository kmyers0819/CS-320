How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
By testing the code and ensuring coverage is at or above 80%, we can ensure the code's functionality meets the requirements. We can also ensure that the code is bug and error free before delivering the final program to the client.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
User needs are interpreted as functional requirments when writing the code. Any functionality that the user desires should be considered a requirement for the code.
How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by identifying the functionality requirements, writing the code in sections and testing in sections as I go. This ensures that we catch bugs and errors early to prevent any snowball effect of errors in the future.
